Hi folks,

This is an advanced lottery smart contract created using hardhat.

This uses chainlink VRF to get a verifiably random number and from that, get a random winner for our lottery.

This also uses chainlink Keepers to automate picking a winner in regular time intervals, whenever the lottery is open and a winner is picked, next round of lottery automatically begins.

This has a deploy script to actually deploy and test the contract on a testnet or your local hardhat network.
